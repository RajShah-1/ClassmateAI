                "content": "## Calculating the Number of Nodes in a Binary Tree\n\nThere are several methods to calculate the number of nodes in a binary tree, each with different time and space complexities. Here are some common approaches:\n\n### 1. **Traversal Methods**\n   - **Pre-order, In-order, Post-order Traversal**: These methods involve visiting each node once and incrementing a counter for each visit. The time complexity is \\( O(n) \\) and the space complexity is \\( O(h) \\) where \\( h \\) is the height of the tree, which is \\( O(\\log n) \\) for a balanced tree and \\( O(n) \\) in the worst case for an unbalanced tree.\n   - **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**: Similar to the above methods but uses a queue to visit nodes level by level. The time and space complexity remains \\( O(n) \\) and \\( O(n) \\) respectively in the worst case.\n\n### 2. **Recursive Approach for Complete Binary Trees**\n   - For **complete binary trees**, where every level except the last is completely filled and the last level is filled from left to right, you can use a more efficient approach:\n     - Calculate the height of the leftmost path and the rightmost path from the root.\n     - If both heights are the same, the tree is perfect up to the second last level, and you can use the formula \\( 2^{height} - 1 \\) to count nodes up to that level.\n     - If the heights differ, the last level is not full, and you need to recursively count nodes in the left and right subtrees.\n\n### 3. **Iterative Approach for Complete Binary Trees**\n   - This method involves similar logic but uses loops instead of recursion:\n     - Calculate the height of the tree.\n     - Use a loop to count the nodes up to the second last level.\n     - For the last level, iterate through the nodes from left to right.\n\n### Example Code for Recursive Approach\n\nHere is a Python example that calculates the number of nodes in a complete binary tree using a recursive approach:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef calculate_height(node):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the height of a given node.\"\"\"\n    if not node:\n        return -1\n    height = 0\n    while node.left:\n        node = node.left\n        height += 1\n    return height\n\ndef count_nodes(root):\n    \"\"\"Count the nodes in a complete binary tree.\"\"\"\n    if not root:\n        return 0\n    \n    left_height = calculate_height(root.left)\n    right_height = calculate_height(root.right)\n    \n    if left_height == right_height:\n        # The last level is completely filled\n        return pow(2, left_height + 1) - 1\n    \n    # Otherwise, the last level is not filled, so count nodes recursively\n    return 1 + count_nodes(root.left) + count_nodes(root.right)\n\n# Example usage\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(6)\nprint(count_nodes(root))\n```\n\nThis approach leverages the properties of complete binary trees to reduce the number of nodes that need to be visited, improving efficiency compared to a simple traversal.",

                "content": "## Performing Search on a Binary Search Tree (BST)\n### Overview\n\nSearching in a Binary Search Tree (BST) is an efficient operation that leverages the properties of BSTs, where each node's left child is less than the parent node, and each right child is greater. This allows for fast lookup of elements in \\( O(\\log n) \\) time in balanced trees and \\( O(n) \\) in the worst case for unbalanced trees.\n\n### Steps to Search for an Element in a BST\n\n1. **Start at the Root Node**: Begin by examining the root node of the BST.\n2. **Compare the Target Value with the Current Node's Value**:\n   - If the target value is **equal** to the current node's value, the search is successful, and you can return the node.\n   - If the target value is **less** than the current node's value, move to the **left child** of the current node.\n   - If the target value is **greater** than the current node's value, move to the **right child** of the current node.\n3. **Repeat the Comparison Process**: Continue steps 2 and 3 until you find the target value or reach a leaf node where the target value does not exist.\n\n### Example Code (Recursive Approach)\n\nHere is a Python example that illustrates how to search for a key in a BST:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef search_BST(root, key):\n    \"\"\"Search for a key in a Binary Search Tree.\"\"\"\n    if root is None or root.data == key:\n        return root\n    \n    if key < root.data:\n        return search_BST(root.left, key)\n    else:\n        return search_BST(root.right, key)\n\n# Example usage\nroot = Node(8)\nroot.left = Node(3)\nroot.right = Node(10)\nroot.left.left = Node(1)\nroot.left.right = Node(6)\nroot.right.right = Node(14)\n\nkey_to_search = 6\nresult = search_BST(root, key_to_search)\n\nif result is not None:\n    print(f\"Key {key_to_search} found.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Key {key_to_search} not found.\")\n```\n\n### Example Code (Iterative Approach)\n\nIf you prefer an iterative solution, you can use a while loop instead of recursion:\n\n```python\ndef search_BST_iterative(root, key):\n    \"\"\"Iterative search for a key in a Binary Search Tree.\"\"\"\n    while root is not None and root.data != key:\n        if key < root.data:\n            root = root.left\n        else:\n            root = root.right\n    return root\n\n# Usage is similar to the recursive example\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n- **Best Case**: \\( O(\\log n) \\) for balanced BSTs.\n- **Worst Case**: \\( O(n) \\) for unbalanced BSTs, which can degenerate into linked lists.\n\n### Space Complexity\n- **Recursive Approach**: \\( O(h) \\), where \\( h \\) is the height of the tree.\n- **Iterative Approach**: \\( O(1) \\), as it uses constant extra space.",
